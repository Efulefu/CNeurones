A simple neural network framework in C

This framework takes a somewhat OOP approach using the magic of structures and pointers.

Documentation pending a first complete version, for now let's just say it's self-documenting code :^)

Will do full documentation when we hit the mark of fully functional and tested network generation,
propagation both ways (input and error), serialization and deserialization to a binary format, as well
as unit tests for all functionalities.

Feedback and advice are absolutely welcome!
